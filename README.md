Steps to create repo from an existing project:

Create a repo with no settings.  
Invite a dev user to repo.  From the dev user's base project directory, run the following commands:

 init
 git add .  <-- this adds all the files and directories to the repo project
 git commit -m "first commit"
 git remote add origin https://github.com/greenorangutan/furry-computing-machine.git
 git remote -v <-- verify that you are pointing to the correct repo
 git push -u origin master
